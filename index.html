                    Harrow Hill AFC, founded in 1932 in the village of Harrow Hill, Gloucestershire, has a proud tradition in local football. Our first team currently competes in the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League, while our Reserves, Thirds, and Fourths play in the North Gloucestershire Football League. In 2025, we welcomed a newly formed U11 youth team, marking our return to youth football after a 15-year absence. Our club is dedicated to providing a welcoming environment for players of all ages and abilities, and to being a hub for the local community, supporters, friends, and families.

                <p class="text-gray-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-base">
                    After joining the Gloucestershire County League in 1982, Harrow Hill AFC rose through the ranks, earning promotion to the Hellenic League Premier Division in the mid-1990s. The club enjoyed several seasons at this level, with notable achievements including runners-up finishes in the Hellenic League Division One West in 1994–95 and 2005–06, and winning the GFA County Cup in 2010–11. Financial challenges in 2009 saw the club return to local football, but Harrow Hill remains a respected name in Gloucestershire football, with a strong community spirit and a commitment to developing players for the future.
